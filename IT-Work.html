        <p class="u-text u-text-2">As a director, Mr. Son is responsible for making
guidance to his team and controlling the quality outcome of the projects that
the bank deploys. Vietcombank has always had good reputation for being one of
the leading banks in the country in digital transformation, namely Vietcombank mobile
trading app and website. The bank, moreover, had always attempted to bring in
the latest technology into their systems. As a result, the projects can be upgrading
IT infrastructures, deploying modern services that enhancing customersâ€™
experience.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Playing the role of a deputy director, Mr. Son
had wide relationship networking, in which he works and cooperates with many partners
and customers. Vietcombank partners in Information Technology are usually
service providers who cooperate with the bank to construct and operate the IT
system. Because of the huge number of customers, it is always the priority of
the bank to operate the system smoothly, safe, and secure, especially in
opening hours when transactions can worth up to billions.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">During Mr. Sonâ€™s working day, he dedicated the
majority of his time to meetings. Meetings are crucial in the IT department and
the bank in general because they need to keep track of system continuously.
Moreover, the bank is operating at international level, which means that there
is absolutely no room for errors even in the closing time of the bank. Any
malfunctions need to be resolved at time of discovering to ensure the perfect condition
of the system. According to Mr. Son, direct meetings are host in case the decision
needs to be approved by several people. On a normal working day, employees in
the bank exchange information via phone calls, email, or online meetings if necessary.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Since the system always need to be in close
supervision, I had some questions for Mr. Son regarding way that Vietcombank operated
during the social distancing when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. To not infringe
with the rules, the bank policies were to divide employees into different
shifts to make sure that there were not too many people at the office. In terms
of the system managing, staffs in the IT department would take turn going to
the bank to supervise the system, errors detected will be noticed via phone
calls or email and online consultation will be hosted to choose the right approach.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">During his several years of experience, Mr. Son
found the most challenging part of his job is timing because of the continually
time he spent at work. Working hours are not applied for employees of the IT department,
the system determines their working hours. There were many occasions that Mr.
Son had to drive all the way from home to the workplace because of the system
malfunctions, and many of which are in the middle of the night. In terms of the
difficulties at work, he thinks the insufficiency in communicating is the
biggest barrier for the work as he stated that there are many times that his
staffs did not provide enough information or run into sophisticated
interpretation, which prevents people from detecting the errors or working out
the right solutions.</p>

IT industry is innovation: this is the industry that transforms the most and
the quickest based on his years of experience. Additionally, information
technology currently is, and will always be the core of the financial field,
especially in banking and management. The industry to him is full of surprises,
and the future of information technology is wider than ever before under the
circumstances that many potential IT innovations are under studying, artificial
intelligence, and machine learning to be specific.</p>
