                        <h1>Overview: Git and GitHub</h1>
                        <p> <h3>Git can be described as a control system in local devices and you use Git to control the project.
                            GitHub is an online service for developers to store their projects (repositories), and it allows multiple developers to work on a project at the same time. Both Git and GitHub
                            feature different commands for developers to make collaborating more conveniently.</h3>
                            <h2>Why Git and GitHub?</h2> <h3>In the past, if a team consists of 3 to 4 people worked on a same project, they would code
                            everything offline in their personal devices and then met up with each other to combine the codes, which had been proved to be insufficient and inconvenient at the same time.
                            Firstly, it might be challenging to find the right time for all team members to gather due to different timetables, and combining the codes in such a way is also time-consuming
                            and the potential of running into bug is really high. Additionally, it is impossible to evaluate the contribution of each team member to the source codes. Git and GitHub help to solve such issue.</h3>
                            <h2>How do they work?</h2>
                            <h3>First, one team member should create a repository to store all the source code of the project. Developers can pull the code from GitHub to work in their personal devices and push them up once 
                            they had completed. Changes in the source code will be recorded, so in case the new codes do not run well, developers can instantly go back to the old version. Overall, Git and GitHub in combination make working in a project more effective for team members, as well as it
                            allows project leader to evaluate precisely the contribution that each member has on the project. Finally, GitHub saves all the work that an individual had contributed to different projects from
                            day one, which means the system would evaluate personal contribution after each project and give credit for such contribution. This can be a major factors  nowadays to employers since it showcases
                            developersâ€™ experience, which might be critical if they want to apply for a job or involve in any projects because employers need to know if an applicant had the right skills or qualifications that
                            they are looking for.</h3></p>
